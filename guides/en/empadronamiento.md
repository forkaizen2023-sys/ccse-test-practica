# First Steps: How to Register Your Address (Empadronamiento) in Alicante

## What is the "Padrón" and What Is It For?

The "Padrón Municipal" is the administrative register where all residents of a municipality are listed. Being registered is both a **right and a duty** for everyone living in Spain.

This registration serves as official proof of your address and is **essential** for accessing numerous public services:

* **Public Healthcare:** It is a key requirement to obtain the Health Card (SIP card).
* **Education:** It facilitates the enrollment of children in schools.
* **Administrative Procedures:** Necessary for renewing documents (DNI, TIE), voting, applying for social benefits, etc.
* **City Planning:** It helps the City Council to plan public services.

This is a **free and mandatory** procedure for all residents, regardless of their nationality or legal status.
