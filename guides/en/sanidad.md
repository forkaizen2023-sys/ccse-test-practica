</div>

## ‚öïÔ∏è Case 1: European Union Citizens

If you are a citizen of the EU, EEA, or Switzerland, the process requires you to first formalize your residency in Spain.

### ‚úÖ Steps to Follow
1.  **Obtain the "Green NIE" (CUE):** This is the EU Citizen Registration Certificate. An appointment ("cita previa") is **mandatory**.
    * **Book your appointment here:** [Public Administrations Office](https://icp.administracionelectronica.gob.es/icpplus/index.html)
2.  **Register with Social Security:** Essential if you are going to work. This is done at the Social Security General Treasury (TGSS).
3.  **Apply for the SIP Card:** Go to your corresponding local health center.

### üìã Documents to Present at the Health Center
* A recent "Empadronamiento" certificate.
* Your passport or national ID card.
* The EU Registration Certificate ("Green NIE").
* Your Social Security registration document (if applicable).

> **üí° Pro Tip:** Although an appointment is not always required at the health center, it's a good idea to call ahead. It will save you time and they can confirm any specific documents needed for that center.

## üåç Case 2: Non-EU Citizens

The process varies depending on your legal status, but registering your address ("empadronamiento") is always the first step.

### ‚úÖ With a Residence and Work Permit
The process is almost identical to that for EU citizens. The main difference is the identification document.

* **Key Document:** Instead of the "Green NIE," you will present your **TIE** (Foreigner's Identity Card).

### ‚úÖ Without Legal Residence (Universal Access)
Spain guarantees access to healthcare. The process is managed through the "Valencian Health Protection Program."

* **Main Requirements:**
    * To be registered on the "padr√≥n" in the Valencian Community for at least 3 months.
    * Not to be entitled to healthcare coverage by any other means (e.g., private insurance).
* **Process:** Go to your local health center and ask to speak with the **Social Worker** ("Trabajador/a Social"). They will assess your case and start the procedure.

> **‚ö†Ô∏è Important Note:** Universal coverage includes primary care, emergencies, and chronic diseases, but may have exclusions for high-cost elective treatments. In a serious emergency, you will always be treated first, and administrative procedures will be handled later.
