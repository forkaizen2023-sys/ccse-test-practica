## ‚öïÔ∏è For European Union Citizens

If you are a citizen of the EU, EEA, or Switzerland, the process is straightforward once you formalize your residency.

* **Step 1: Obtain the Green NIE (Registration Certificate)**
    This is requested at the Foreigners' Office ("Oficina de Extranjer√≠a"). An online appointment is **mandatory**.

* **Step 2: Register with Social Security**
    If you are going to work, this is an essential step done at the Social Security General Treasury (TGSS).

* **Step 3: Go to Your Local Health Center**
    With your Padr√≥n certificate, Green NIE, and Social Security document, find your nearest health center to apply for the card.

## üåç For Non-EU Citizens

The process depends on your residency status.

* **Case A: With a Residence and Work Permit**
    The process is very similar to that for EU citizens. You must present your **Padr√≥n**, **TIE** (Foreigner's Identity Card), passport, and Social Security registration document at your health center.

* **Case B: Without Legal Residence (Universal Access)**
    Access is provided through the "Valencian Health Protection Program." You need to prove you have been registered on the "Padr√≥n" for more than 3 months and have no other health coverage.
