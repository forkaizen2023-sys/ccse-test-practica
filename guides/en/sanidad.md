## ⚕️ For European Union Citizens

If you are a citizen of the EU, EEA, or Switzerland, the process is straightforward once you have formalized your residency.

* **Step 1: Obtain the Green NIE (Registration Certificate)**
    Apply for it at the Foreigners' Office ("Oficina de Extranjería") by appointment. You will need your passport, proof of financial means (work contract, insurance, etc.), and the [EX-18 form](https://www.inclusion.gob.es/web/migraciones/modelos-generales-de-solicitudes). The appointment is booked on the [Public Administrations website](https://sede.administracionespublicas.gob.es/icpplus/).

* **Step 2: Register with Social Security**
    This is essential if you are going to work as an employee or self-employed. It is done at the Social Security General Treasury (TGSS) with your NIE and contract.

* **Step 3: Go to Your Health Center**
    Find your corresponding health center using the [GVA Center Finder](https://www.san.gva.es/es/web/dgaf/buscador-centros). You will need to bring:
    * Your "Padrón" certificate.
    * Your Passport and Green NIE.
    * Your Social Security registration document.
    They will issue a temporary SIP card on the spot, and the permanent one will arrive by mail.

## 🌍 For Non-EU Citizens

The process depends on your residency status.

* **Case A: With a Residence and Work Permit**
    The process is very similar to that for EU citizens. You will need to present your **Padrón**, your **TIE** (Foreigner's Identity Card), passport, and Social Security registration document at your health center.

* **Case B: Without Legal Residence (Universal Access)**
    Access is provided through the "Valencian Health Protection Program."
    * **Requirements:** You must be registered on the "Padrón" for more than 3 months and have no other health coverage.
    * **Documents:** Padrón certificate, passport, and a declaration of no insurance.
    * **Coverage:** It includes primary care, emergency services, and specialized care, but may have limitations on high-cost treatments.
